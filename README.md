# Udacity Project: Data Pipelines
This educational project is about enabling data analysis in a fictional startup called Sparkify. An ETL pipeline that uses Apache Airflow as workflow management platform:
- extracts user activity and 
- song data from AWS S3, 
- stages them in AWS Redshift, 
- transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for the analytics team and
- performs data quality checks.

**Data analysis enablement goals**  
- load data from S3 
- query song play data, meaning songs that users are listing to.  

**Initial situation**
- no easy way to query song play data due to source data structure.  
- directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app.  
- directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.  


## Purpose of database and design
The purpose of this AWS Redshift database is to ease queries on song play data. The stored data is extracted from JSON user log files and JSON song metadata files.  
The database design follows a classic star structure. The fact table at the center is "songplays". It references 4 dimension tables: users, songs, artists, time. Additionally there are two staging tables for data load from the S3 source.

### Fact table "songplays"
As mentioned above this is fact table which enables easy queries on songs that users are listing to.  
Its elements (column_name data_type) are:  
- songplay_id INT IDENTITY(0,1) PRIMARY KEY: automatically generated for each load from a user log file.
- start_time TIMESTAMP REFERENCES time(start_time): reference to fact table "time"
- user_id INT REFERENCES users(user_id): reference to fact table "users"
- level VARCHAR NOT NULL
- song_id VARCHAR REFERENCES songs(song_id): reference to fact table "songs"
- artist_id VARCHAR REFERENCES artists(artist_id): reference to fact table "artist_id"
- session_id INT
- location VARCHAR
- user_agent VARCHAR

### Dimension table "users"
Dimension table that stores user data.
- user_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,\
- first_name VARCHAR,\
- last_name VARCHAR,\
- gender VARCHAR,\
- level VARCHAR NOT NULL
                                                        
### Dimension table "songs"
Dimension table that stores song data.
- song_id VARCHAR NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,\
- title VARCHAR,\
- artist_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,\
- year INT,\
- duration NUMERIC
                                                        
### Dimension table "artists"
Dimension table that stores artist data.
- artist_id VARCHAR NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,\
- name VARCHAR,\
- location VARCHAR,\
- latitude NUMERIC(9,5),\
- longitude NUMERIC(9,5))

### Dimension table "time"
Dimension table describes time and data information based on the provided timestamp.
- start_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,\
- hour INT,\
- day INT,\
- week INT,\
- month INT,\
- year INT,\
- weekday INT

### Staging table "staging_events"
- event_raw_id INT IDENTITY(0,1) PRIMARY KEY,\
- artist VARCHAR,\
- auth VARCHAR,\
- first_name VARCHAR,\
- gender VARCHAR,\
- item_in_session INT,\
- last_name VARCHAR,\
- length NUMERIC,\
- level VARCHAR,\
- location VARCHAR,\
- method VARCHAR,\
- page VARCHAR,\
- registration VARCHAR,\
- session_id INT,\
- song VARCHAR,\
- status INT,\
- ts DOUBLE PRECISION,\
- user_agent  VARCHAR,\
- user_id INT

### Staging table "staging_songs"
- song_raw_id INT IDENTITY(0,1) PRIMARY KEY, \
- artist_id  VARCHAR,\
- artist_latitude VARCHAR,\
- artist_location VARCHAR,\
- artist_longitude VARCHAR,\
- artist_name VARCHAR,\
- duration NUMERIC,\
- num_songs INT,\
- song_id  VARCHAR,\
- title VARCHAR,\
- year INT

## Airflow Data Pipeline
- The data pipeline consists of one dag that uses 4 custom operators to perform 10 tasks.
- all SQL transformations are stored in a helper file sql_queries.py

### DAG
- DAG settings:
  - The DAG does not have dependencies on past runs.
  - On failure, the task are retried 3 times.
  - Retries happen every 5 minutes.
  - Catchup is turned off.
  - No email on retry.
- DAG tasks & operators:
	- start_operator: Dummy Operator
    - stage_events_to_redshift: Stage Operator
    - stage_songs_to_redshift: Stage Operator
	- load_songplays_table: Fact Operator
    - load_song_dimension_table: Dimension Operator
    - load_user_dimension_table: Dimension Operator
    - load_artist_dimension_table: Dimension Operator
    - load_time_dimension_table: Dimension Operator
    - run_quality_checks: Data Quality Operator
    - end_operator: Dummy Operator

### Operators
#### Stage Operator stage_redshift.py
- loads any JSON formatted files from S3 to Amazon Redshift. 
- creates and runs a SQL COPY statement based on the parameters provided. 
- The operator's parameters specify where in S3 the file is loaded and the target table in AWS Redshift.
- parameters:
	- redshift_conn_id : name of Airflow connection to AWS Redshift database.
    - aws_credentials_id : name of Airflow connection that provides AWS credentials
    - table : name of target AWS Redshift database table for copy from S3. 
    - s3_bucket : S3 bucket
    - s3_key: S3 key
    - json : COPY options for JSON (see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/copy-usage_notes-copy-from-json.html for details)
    - region : AWS region in which Redshift database is hosted.

#### Fact Operator load_fact.py
- creates fact table from data in staging tables.
- parameters:
	- redshift_conn_id : name of Airflow connection to AWS Redshift database.
    - table : name of target AWS Redshift database facts table. 
	- sql_query : sql query for insert from staging table to facts table.

#### Dimension Operator load_dimension.py
- creates dimension table from data in staging tables.
- parameters:
	- redshift_conn_id : name of Airflow connection to AWS Redshift database.
    - table : name of target AWS Redshift database facts table. 
    - insert_mode: value "delete-load" truncates table before inserting other values. All other values append data.
	- sql_query : sql query for insert from staging table to facts table.


#### Data Quality Operator data_quality.py
- receive one or more SQL based test cases along with the expected results and execute the tests. 
- For each the test, the test result and expected result needs to be checked and if there is no match, the operator should raise an exception and the task should retry and fail eventually.
- parameters:
	- redshift_conn_id : name of Airflow connection to AWS Redshift database.
    - sql_checks: list of sql queries for data quality checks. Data quality checks succeed, if the returned record are greater than one and not null.

## Example queries
- get number of users per level:  
``` sql
SELECT level, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) 
FROM songplays 
GROUP BY level.
```
- Reference song title and song duration from table songs to fact table:  
``` sql
SELECT DISTINCT songplays.song_id, songplays.artist_id, songs.title, songs.duration
FROM songplays JOIN songs
ON songplays.song_id = songs.song_id
ORDER BY title
```


## OPTIONAL: Question for the reviewer
